# Graduate-Statistics-Sequence

This repository contains material from MATH 525 and 526, the graduate sequence in statistics, from
the University of Tennessee, Knoxville during the Fall 2023 - Spring 2024 academic year.
The professor for the class was Dr. Vasileios Maroulas and we loosely followed the textbook
*Data Modeling for the Sciences: Applications, Basics, Computations* by Steve Press√© and Ioannis
Sgouralis.
